# LSTM neural network for Time Series Prediction for real weather data from Kenya

## Introduction
The data was gathered over the course of 4 years by multiple weather stations in Kenya as a research project by the Justus Liebig Universität Gießen.
It contains many different weather parameters. You can find information about them in Pars.csv.

The idea is to use LSTM neural networks to predict weather parameters that are traditionally costly to measure and therefore not available in many places.
